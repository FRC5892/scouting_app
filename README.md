# Scouting App (tentative title)

This is FRC team 5892's _extremely work-in-progress_ scouting app. The intent is to create an application that will help scouts organize their data in a manner optimized for the scarce WiFi present at competitions.

The application will provide scouts with a set of forms to fill out (pit interviews, matches, etc.), and allow them to be manually synced to a cloud database. Our current plan is to use Google Firebase for this.

We also would like for other teams to be able to download and use our app themselves.

The app is written using Flutter to hopefully release both Android and iOS versions.
