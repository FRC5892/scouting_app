Okay. So I'm going to have to burn the home screen to the ground.
In FormsHome, the "Add" button in the AppBar needs to be able to update the same State that the body is under.
Meaning I can't keep them separate anymore.
The main reason I separated them is so they could be separated from the BottomNavigationBar.
That definitely needs to be separate... unless HomeViews are responsible for rendering it themselves?
Huh. This seems like a good idea.
HomeView probably couldn't be an interface at that point tho.
Maybe make a static method in HomeView for rendering the bar?
Anything that implements HomeView (all both of them) would need to provide their index to the navbar.
Then each HomeView's build() method would build a Scaffold and put the navbar in its place.
The HomeScreen would only need to manage showing the proper view at the proper time.
Maybe use a GlobalKey for the appbar/navbar? It might be necessary. Don't overcomplicate it if it looks good without one.

...you know what? Let's just use a Stream. That seems way less complicated.
Time to go look up how Streams work.
